## Context

This application was produced during the month of June 2020 in order to work with Node JS including the development of a basic REST API with Express JS. This application is closer to an exercise result than a functional tool.

A filter is available in order to be able to act on the number of entries displayed as well as a sorting function by creation date.

## Architecture

The front end was done with React JS, the page routing with React Router v6 the back end with Node JS and Express JS. The database is running SQlite3 model.
